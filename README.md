## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I Learned
During the completion of this challenge, I learned some useful techniques and concepts related to:
- Flexbox for creating responsive layouts
- HTML structure for building semantic web pages
- CSS properties and selectors for styling elements effectively

## Challenges Faced
One of the challenges I faced was aligning the elements perfectly as per the design. It required precise use of Flexbox and understanding of spacing properties. Additionally, making the component fully responsive was a learning curve that I successfully overcame.

## Continued Development
I plan to continue working on more Frontend Mentor challenges to further improve my skills. Additionally, I will be exploring advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript to add interactivity to my projects.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Frontend Mentor for providing this amazing platform to practice front-end development skills and for the community support. Special thanks to everyone who reviewed and provided feedback on my solution.
